write me a flask app with a modern ui that works like sailpoint identity iq. I only need the part were you (1) search and mark user
s and (2) search and assign a group and (3) review and submit the change. There should be at least 2 tabs for user search and group s
earch, user search results are displayed as tiles that can be maked, marked users show up in a box "Identities Selected" right below
the search box, this allows for multiple searches, the identities selected also show up in the second tab for group search
